title: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in OmniAuth's request phase
date: 2015-05-25

description: |
  The request phase in OmniAuth is currently vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery, which allows an attacker to easily gain full access to a user's
  account on a site that uses OmniAuth, when used in combination with another
  CSRF vulnerability on the side of a connected OAuth provider.
